# Human-Type
An AutoHotkey script that will type out copied text emulating the way a human would type it.
Emulates the way a human would type something out, perfect for pasting AI (or other) writing and making it seem like you did it.
Types with a random delay between letters and sometimes deletes and rewrites words or letters.
